Installing a Virtual Environment and Flask

For your own development purposes it is good to get in the habit of using a virtual environment. Using Python 3.4 it is really easy.

1) Make a Folder in your home directory called Environments

2) run the command python3 -m venv ~/Environments/flaskenv

3) Now run the command . ~/Environments/flaskenv/bin/activate This activates the python virtual environment and sets up everything so that you will run a special Python contained in the virtual environment. Best of all you now have permission to install any third party python packages into your own virtual environment without needing root permission.

4) run pip install flask
       pip install requests
       pip install flask_wtf
       pip install -U Flask-SQLAlchemy (12/15/2019)
       pip install records (12/15/2019)

After installing flask you can verify that everything is good by running pip list you should see the following:

Flask (0.10.1)
itsdangerous (0.24)
Jinja2 (2.7.3)
MarkupSafe (0.23)
pip (1.5.6)
setuptools (2.1)
Werkzeug (0.9.6)
