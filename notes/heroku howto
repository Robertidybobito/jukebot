1) tell it how to build the app
	Python -> requirements.txt file
	pip freeze creates the requirements.txt file
2) what runtime environment should Heroku be using
	contained in runtime.txt
	we just put in the version on Python we use
3) How to run?
	Procfile // capital P, plain text file
	web: gunicorn
	app: app
	(might be "web: gunicorn app:app")
	app:app because of our app.py file and app object

this will all be packaged in a git repo
	remote repo that is on heroku
	remote - heroku

--------------------------------
install the heroku command line
> heroku version
> heroku login
> git init
intializes an empty repo
> git add
> git commit
> heroku create
creates an app for you
> git remote -v
should tell me "heroku https://git.heroku.com/..."
if wrong, will say "https://git.umn.edu/..."
> pip list
tells us everything we have installed
may need to use pip install
